        "*  Disadvantages: Since ReLU is only when the units are positive and zeros, the problems that can arise from this can be leftover positve bias for later layers because the mean activiation is greater than zero. One way to mitigate this disadvantage can be using batch normalization to move the mean towards zero.\n",

Instead of feeding all available information into a neural network, a RNN feeds information from one point in the sequence at a time. However, the RNN contains a loop so that the output from one point in the sequence feeds back into the network to capture context that helps in prediction.\n",

This allows the neural network to learn more complex patterns. This example code creates a sequence of random integers for training and testing.\n",

This implementation will include a recently used topic to implement CNN which is primarily used to classify images, and identify patterns between them. The box of the picture is intepreteded by the number of pixels defining the height and width of the box, and with a depth of 3 for each letter pertaining to RGB. Then, pass each square of pixels and pass it through a filter.\n",
